## Step 1 - Plotly.js

 - Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.
 - Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display the top 10 samples.
 - Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display each sample.
 - Display the sample metadata from the route /metadata/<sample>
 - Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page
 - Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
   - See app.js and bonus.js in /static/js folder


## Step 2 - Heroku

 - Deploy your Flask app to Heroku.

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

 - The following task is completely optional and is very advanced.
 - Adapt the Gauge Chart from https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/ to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency obtained from the route /wfreq/<sample>

## Flask API

 - Use Flask API starter code to serve the data needed for your plots.
 - Test your routes by visiting each one in the browser.
